The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the `calc()` function:  ```css #container { width: calc(100% - 20px); } #element { width: calc(50% - 10px); } ``` This code intends to create a container that takes up 100% of its parent's width minus 20px and an element that is 50% of the container's width minus 10px.  The problem arises when the `calc()` expression results in a negative value. For instance, if the container's width is less than 20px, the calculation for `#container`'s width will be negative. Similarly, if the container's width is less than 20px, `#element`'s width calculation may also become negative, leading to unexpected rendering or layout issues.
